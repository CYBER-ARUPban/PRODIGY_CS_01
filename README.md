 Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

Overview

This project implements the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique that shifts the letters of a message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. The project includes both encryption and decryption functionalities.

Features

Encrypts plain text using a shift-based Caesar cipher.

Decrypts cipher text back to plain text.

Allows users to specify a custom shift value.

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.

Ignores non-alphabetic characters, keeping them unchanged.

Installation

To run the program, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

Ensure you have Python installed, then run the script:

Usage

Encryption

Run the script and provide the following inputs:

The text to encrypt.

The shift value (e.g., 3 for shifting letters forward by 3 positions).

Example:

Decryption

Run the script with the encrypted text and the same shift value to decrypt it back.

Example:

Example Code

Hereâ€™s a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher:
